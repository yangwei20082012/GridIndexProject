# GridIndexProject

This repository contains codes and test dataset to reproduce the results in the manuscript.The codes are written 100% in C# and can be run any other .net supporting platforms.

Code: The core code is the "RaduceByGridAndDP()" method located in the "MainForm.CS" file. Due to the large amount of code involved, the code provided here is only the core code of the algorithm. Full code can be obtained by contacting the author. For more information contact yw2008_2012@163.com

Notes: Run the file "Countries02.shp" to produce Figures 7,10. Run the file "BOUNT_poly.shp" to produce Figures 8, 9 and 11.
